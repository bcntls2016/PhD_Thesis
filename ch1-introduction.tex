\chapter{Introduction}
	Superfluids are liquids and gases with remarkable properties. In particular, superfluid helium can flow through a capillary without friction due to its extremely small viscosity (at least 1500 times smaller than normal liquid helium\citep{Kapitza1938}), or creep up the wall of a container, seemingly defying the force of gravity\citep{Rollin1939} (``Rollin creeping''). Its thermal conductivity is about $3\times10^6$ times higher than that of liquid helium I or about 200 times higher than that of copper at room temperature\citep{Keesom1936}. It therefore earned the title of ``best heat conducting substance we know'' by Willem and his daughter Anna Keesom and dubbed ``\emph{supra-heat-conducting}''\citep{Keesom1936}. Later it was understood why\citep{Tisza1938-1,Tisza1938-2,Tisza1940-1,Tisza1940-2} and it turns out that heat doesn't diffuse through the medium as in normal liquids, but rather it travels through the medium in waves (second sound). This makes it an ideal coolant e.g. to stabilise the superconducting magnets in CERN's Large Hadron Collider\citep{Lebrun1994}. Helium is also the only known substance that stays liquid at zero temperature and low pressures and both its angular momentum and vorticity are quantised, making it the first observed macroscopic quantum substance. Helium-4 becomes superfluid below the $\lambda$-point, named so by William H. Keesom in 1936 who measured a singularity in the specific heat at $T_\lambda=2.2\unit{K}$\citep{Keesom1936}.

	\section{A brief history of superfluidity}
		\lettrine[lines=3,findent=3pt,nindent=0pt]{H}{elium} was the last gas to be liquefied and was done so by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1908\citep{Onnes1908,Onnes1909}. In 1932 John McLennan saw that liquid helium stopped boiling below $\approx\!2.2\unit{K}$\citep{McLennan1932} and later that year Willem Keesom and his daughter Anna observed, while measuring the temperature dependence of the specific heat, a singularity around the same temperature\citep{Keesom1932}. They called it the ``$\lambda$-temperature'',  $T_\lambda$, because of the shape of the temperature dependence of the specific heat resembling the Greek letter $\lambda$ (see Figure \ref{fig:specific-heat}). A few years later in 1935 Burton measured a sharp decrease in the viscosity of liquid helium below $T_\lambda$\citep{Burton1935}. Around the same time Fritz London was already thinking about macroscopic wave functions and why helium does not freeze at $T=0\unit{K}$ under atmospheric pressure\citep{London1935}. London and Simon concluded that it was caused by the zero point motion of the helium atoms and their associated kinetic energy that is comparable to their Van der Waals energy, effectively preventing liquid helium to solidify\citep{Simon1934,London1936}. The year after, in 1936, Willem and Anna Keesom measured an abnormally high heat conductance below $T_\lambda$\citep{Keesom1936}. This was confirmed roughly one year later by J.F. Allen \emph{et al.}\citep{Allen1937} and it was understood that the high thermal conductance was the reason for the helium to stop boiling whenever the temperature drops below $T_\lambda$. It was in 1937, when Kapitza tried to determine the viscosity of the laminar flow, that he measured a viscosity that was about $10^4$ times smaller than that of hydrogen gas\citep{Kapitza1938}. It was then that Kaptiza who, by analogy with superconductors, first coined the word ``superfluid''\citep{Kapitza1938} to describe the special state that helium enters below the $\lambda$-point where it can flow, seemingly without friction. Allen and Misener realised that superfluid helium is not just a liquid with a very low viscosity, but that its hydrodynamics was completely different from that of ordinary liquids\citep{Allen1938} and therefore required a completely new interpretation.\\
		
		The start of this new interpretation was made by London\citep{London1938} in 1938 when he made a connection between the behaviour of superfluid helium and that of an ideal ``Bose--Einstein'' (BE) gas. Both his calculated value for $T_c=3.09\unit{K}$ and the behaviour of the temperature dependence of the heat capacity for the ideal BE-gas were very similar to the measured ones for liquid helium below $T_\lambda$. He wrote to Nature that ``it was difficult not to imagine a connection with ``Bose--Einstein condensation'' (BEC). Tisza expanded upon London's ideas\citep{Tisza1938} and considered a Helium II system of total $N$ atoms to consist of two parts; a macroscopic ``condensed'' part $n_0$, the superfluid component, in the ground state, and the remaining part $n=N-n_0$, the normal component, where the helium atoms are distributed over the excited states. Assuming this was correct the fraction $n_0/N$ should decrease with increasing temperature according to the equation\\
		\begin{align}
			\frac{n_0}{N} = 1-\qty(\frac{T}{T_0})^s \quad \text{for} \quad T<T_0
		\end{align}
		where $s=3/2$ for an ideal gas and should be taken larger, e.g. $s=5$, for a real liquid with stronger interactions between the atoms.\\
		
		This was the birth of the ``two-fluid'' model. With this model he derived two hydrodynamic equations for liquid helium below $T_\lambda$ and discovered that within it, heat propagates in waves instead of diffusing through the medium, and calculated the velocity of these waves. He also explained why the viscosity is disappearing at low temperatures contrary to classical liquids where the viscosity increases\citep{Tisza1938-1,Tisza1938-2,Tisza1940-1,Tisza1940-2}. In 1941 Lev Landau reformulated Tisza's theory on a more rigorous footing\citep{Landau1941,Landau1949}. He assumed, contrary to Tisza, that the normal component of the liquid was made-up of collective excitations instead of excited single atoms. He postulated that the liquid could exhibit two states of motion which he called ``potential motion'' that is irrotational ($\curl{\vec{v}}=0$), and ``vortex motion'' that is rotational ($\curl{\vec{v}} \neq 0$). The corresponding energies of these two motions are discontinuously separated by an energy gap $\Delta$. In case of potential internal motion  the excitations are quanta of longitudinal (sound) waves, i.e., phonons. The excitations of the vortex-spectrum could be called ``rotons'' (see Figure \ref{fig:phonon-roton}).\\

		\end{figure}

		A theoretical demonstration, explicitly showing that phonons and rotons are collective excitations of the liquid, came in the form of a 1947 paper by Nikolay Bogolyubov\citep{Bogolyubov1947}. The intimate relationship between superfluidity and BEC was not universally accepted until 1995 when Cornell and Wienman in Colorado and Ketterle at MIT discovered BEC in rubidium quantum gases\citep{Cornell2002,Ketterle2002}.

	\section{Some key concepts}
		\lettrine[lines=3,findent=3pt,nindent=0pt]{I}{n} this section I will briefly introduce some key ideas that are used throughout the thesis and that are needed to fully appreciate the discussed material. Also references to more complete and more in-depth treatments will be provided for the interested reader.
		
		\subsection{Bose-Einstein condensation and long-range order}
			The essential concept of Bose-Einstein condensation is the fact that at low temperatures, multiple bosons, unlike fermions, will occupy the same quantum state. In theory there is no upper bound of how many bosons can occupy such a single state. It is then said that, with ever decreasing temperature, a macroscopic part of the total number of bosons will ``condense'' into the quantum state with the lowest energy.\\			
			
			Another important concept in BEC is the idea of long-range order. Let us start by introducing the one-body density matrix of a system of $N$ bosons in a pure state $\Psi_k(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,\ldots,\vec{r}_N)$
			\begin{align}
				n^{(1)}_k(\vec{r},\vec{r'}) \vcentcolon= N\int\!	\Psi_k^*(\vec{r},\vec{r}_2,\ldots,\vec{r}_N)\Psi_k(\vec{r'},\vec{r}_2,\ldots,\vec{r}_N)\diff{r}_2\diff{r}_3\ldots\diff{r}_N	\label{eq:def-obd-matrix}
			\end{align}
			where the integral is taken over the $N-1$ coordinates $\vec{r}_2,\vec{r}_3,\ldots,\vec{r}_N$. For a statistical mixture of quantum states one needs to take the weighted average over all the different $\Psi_k$-states. In thermodynamic equilibrium the states are Boltzmann weighted by their eigenvalues $\qty{E_k}$
			\begin{align}
				n^{(1)}(\vec{r},\vec{r'}) = \frac{1}{Q}\sum_k n^{(1)}_k(\vec{r},\vec{r'}) \unit{e}^{-E_k/k_BT}
			\end{align}
			where $Q$ is the partition function. For more general cases the one-body density matrix is defined
			\begin{align}
				n^{(1)}(\vec{r},\vec{r'}) \vcentcolon=\expval{\hat\Psi^\dagger(\vec{r})\hat\Psi(\vec{r'})}
			\end{align}
			where $\hat\Psi^\dagger(\vec{r})$/$\hat\Psi(\vec{r})$ are field-operators creating/annihilating a boson at $\vec{r}$ and the averaging $\expval{\cdots}$ is taken over all states in the mixture. Once it is accepted that a macroscopic part of the total number of bosons can occupy a single quantum state it can be demonstrated that, while considering a uniform isotropic sytem of $N$ bosons, the one-body density matrix (Eq. \ref{eq:def-obd-matrix}) tends to a constant value when the distance between $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{r}'$ goes to infinity. In the thermodynamic limit where $N,V\rightarrow\infty$ such that $n=N/V$ is kept fixed, the one-body density only depends on the modulus of the relative variable $\vec{s}:=\vec{r}-\vec{r}'$ so that we can write it as the Fourier transform of the momentum distribution as
			\begin{align}
				n^{(1)}(s) = \frac{1}{V}\int \! n^{(1)}\qty(\vec{p})\exp(i\vec{p}\cdot\vec{s}/\hbar)\,\mathrm{d}\vec{p} \label{eq:one-body-den-mom}
			\end{align}
			For a Bose-Einstein condensed system, the momentum distribution at small momenta is not smooth but has a sharp peak around $p=0$ for the bosons that are in the ground state, while the remaining bosons are smoothly distributed over the excited states.
			\begin{align}
				n(\vec{p})=N_0\delta(\vec{p})+\tilde{n}(\vec{p})
			\end{align}
			where $\tilde{n}$ is a smoothly varying function of $\vec{p}$. When this expression is plugged into Eq. (\ref{eq:one-body-den-mom}) and taking the limit where $s$ goes to infinity
			\begin{align}
				\lim_{s\rightarrow\infty}n^{(1)}(s)=\frac{N_0}{V},
			\end{align}
			where $N_0/V \vcentcolon= n_0\leq 1$ is called the condensate fraction. It is called long-range order since it involves the off-diagonal elements of the one-body density matrix; the elements that are usually associated with the coherences.\\
			
			A set of eigenvalues \{$n_i$\} of the one-body density matrix can be defined through the following eigenvalue equation
			\begin{align}
				\int \! n^{(1)}(\vec{r},\vec{r'})\varphi_i(\vec{r'}) \,\mathrm{d}\vec{r'} = n_i\varphi_i(\vec{r})
			\end{align}
			and its solutions \{$\varphi_i$\} form a natural orthonormal basis set of single boson wave functions $\int\!\varphi_i^*\varphi_j\,\mathrm{d}\vec{r}=\delta_{ij}$, with normalisation condition $\sum_i n_i=N$. This permits writing the on-body density matrix in a useful diagonalised form and recalling that Bose-Einstein condensation occurs when a single particle state $\varphi_i$ is occupied in a macroscopic way, say when $n_{i=0}=N_0$, a number of order $N$, we separate the condensate part from the rest
			\begin{align}
				n^{(1)}(\vec{r},\vec{r'}) = N_0\varphi_0^*(\vec{r})\varphi_0(\vec{r'})+\sum_{i\neq0}n_i\varphi_i^*(\vec{r})\varphi_i(\vec{r'}) \label{eq:obdm-diag}
			\end{align}

		\subsection{Bogolyubov's approximation and the order parameter}\label{sec:bogol-order}
			It is customary, given the importance of the condensate fraction $N_0$ in a BEC, to write the field operator of a $N$-body boson system as the sum of the condensate part and the rest, just as the one-body density matrix
			\begin{align}
				\hat{\Psi}(\vec{r})=\varphi_0(\vec{r})\hat{a}_0 + \sum_{i\neq 0} \varphi_i(\vec{r})\hat{a}_i \label{eq:field-operator}
			\end{align}
			where the $\hat{a}_i$ and $\hat{a}_i^\dagger$ are annihilation and creation operator of a particle in state $\varphi_i$ and obey the usual bosonic commutation relations
			\begin{align}
				\commutator{\hat{a}_i}{\hat{a}_j^\dagger}=\delta_{ij},\quad 	\commutator{\hat{a}_i}{\hat{a}_j}=0=\commutator{\hat{a}_i^\dagger}{\hat{a}_j^\dagger}
			\end{align}
			Using Eq. (\ref{eq:field-operator}) in Eq. (\ref{eq:def-obd-matrix}) and comparing it to Eq. (\ref{eq:obdm-diag}) one finds the expectation value of $\expectationvalue{\hat{a}_j^\dagger\,\hat{a}_i}=\delta_{ij}n_i$. Now, the Bogolyubov approximation essentially replaces the operators $\hat{a}_0$ and $\hat{a}_0^\dagger$ with the $c$-number\footnote{The term $c$-number is old nomenclature for a classical number, which can be real or complex, to distinguish them from quantum numbers, or $q$-numbers, that are represented by operators.} $\sqrt{N_0}$. This is equivalent to ignoring the non-commutative nature of the operators due to the macroscopic occupation of the state $\varphi_0$, when $N_0=\expectationvalue{\hat{a}_0^\dagger\,\hat{a}_0}\gg 1$. We then rewrite the field operator as the sum of a classical field for the condensed component and quantum field for the non-condensed component
			\begin{align}
				\hat{\Psi}(\vec{r})=\Psi_0(\vec{r})+\delta\hat{\Psi}(\vec{r}),\label{eq:order-param-real}
			\end{align}
			where $\delta\hat{\Psi}(\vec{r})=\sum_{i\neq 0}\varphi_i(\vec{r})\hat{a}_i$ and $\Psi_0(\vec{r})=\sqrt{N_0}\varphi_0(\vec{r})$. At $T=0$ the whole system is condensed and one can ignore $\delta\hat{\Psi}$ altogether; the field operator becomes a normal function of space $\Psi_0$.\\
			
			The classical field $\Psi_0$ is called the \emph{effective}- or \emph{macroscopic} wave function of the condensate and it behaves like an order parameter in the sense that it varies continuously between a maximum value $\sqrt{N}$, that is proportional to the total number particles in the system, at $T=0$, and vanishes at the superfluid-normal fluid phase transition temperature $T_\lambda$. It is a complex quantity characterised by a real-valued modulus and phase $S$:
			\begin{align}
				\Psi_0(\vec{r}) = \absolutevalue{\sqrt{N_0}\varphi_0(\vec{r)}}\,\mathrm{e}^{iS(\vec{r})}\label{eq:order-param-complex}
			\end{align}
			The modulus determines the number-density of the condensate, while the phase $S$ plays an important role in the coherence and properties of the superfluid. As we will see in Section \ref{sec:rot-vort}, $S$ plays the role of a velocity potential.\\
			
			Using an order parameter as defined here is equivalent to using the many-body wave function
			\begin{align}
				\Phi(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,\ldots\vec{r}_N)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}\varphi_0(\vec{r}_i),
			\end{align}
			with a density operator $\hat{\rho}(\vec{r}) \vcentcolon= \sum_{i=1}^{N}\delta(\vec{r}-\vec{r}_i)$ (see Section \ref{sec:dft-method}). One way to see why this wave function plays the role of an order parameter is to look at its time dependence. For normal wave functions the time dependence is determined by the eigenvalues $E_i$ of the Hamiltonian of the system
			\begin{align}
				\Psi(\vec{r},t)=\psi(\vec{r})\,\mathrm{e}^{-iE_it/\hbar}
			\end{align}
			But in this case, the time dependence is determined by the chemical potential $\mu=E(N)-E(N-1)\approx \partial E/\partial N$
			\begin{align}
				\Psi_0(\vec{r},t)=\Psi_0(\vec{r})\,\mathrm{e}^{-i\mu t/\hbar} \label{eq:td-order-param}
			\end{align}
			Another aspect of $\Psi_0$ being an order parameter and not a true many-body wave function is that two solutions $\Psi_a$ and $\Psi_b$ of the non-linear droplet Hamiltonian corresponding to two different values of the chemical potential $\mu_a$ and $\mu_b$ are not necessarily orthogonal, i.e. $0 \leq N^{-1}\int\!\Psi_a^*\Psi_b\unit{d}\vec{r} < 1$. However, in dilute gases it is possible to construct a many-body wave function from the order parameter that regains its orthonormality in the thermodynamic limit
			\begin{align}
				\Phi_0(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,\ldots,\vec{r}_N) = \qty(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\Psi_0(\vec{r}_1))\qty(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\Psi_0(\vec{r}_2))\cdots\qty(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\Psi_0(\vec{r}_N))
			\end{align}
			
		\subsection{Landau's criterion for superfluidity}
			\begin{figure}[t]
				\begin{center}
					\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{dispersion-relation}
					\caption{Dispersion relation for elementary excitations in liquid $^4$He calculated as in  \cite{Mat10a}. `Basic' indicates the OT-DFT without the non-local kinetic energy correlation (KC) nor the back-flow (BF) terms; KC OT-DFT adds  to the basic OT-DFT the KC term; BF OT-DFT adds to the basic OT-DFT the BF term. The dots are the experimental data from \cite{Don81}. The Landau velocity $v_L = E(q)/(\hbar\,q)|_{min}$ obtained for each functional is  60.3 m/s (OT-DFT); 75.1 m/s (BF OT-DFT); 94.4 m/s (KC OT-DFT); 118 m/s (basic OT-DFT); and 57.5 (experiment).}
					\label{fig:dispersion-relation}
				\end{center}
			\end{figure}
		
			For a gas or liquid to be able to become superfluid Landau postulated that the energy dispersion relation needs to fulfil certain requirements. Specifically for a fluid to flow  without dissipation, i.e. a super-flow, the velocity field needs to fulfil the following inequality:
			\begin{align}
				v<v_c = \min_{\vec{p}}\frac{\epsilon(\vec{p})}{p}
			\end{align}
			
			For an ideal Bose gas $\epsilon(\vec{p})= \frac{p^2}{2m}$. In this case 
			\begin{align}
				v_c &= \min_{\vec{p}}\frac{\epsilon(\vec{p})}{p} \\
					&= \min_{\vec{p}}\frac{p}{2m} \\
					&= 0
			\end{align}
			Apparently ideal Bose-gases cannot become superfluid.\\
			
			But if we allow for some weak interactions between the bosons the energy dispersion relation is given by
			\begin{align}
				\epsilon(\vec{p})=\sqrt{\frac{gn}{m}p^2+\qty(\frac{p^2}{2m})^2},
			\end{align}
			Bogolyubov's dispersion law for elementary excitations (1947). And thus
			\begin{align}
				v_c &=\min_{\vec{p}}\sqrt{\frac{gn}{m}+\frac{p^2}{4m^2}} \\
					&= \sqrt{\frac{gn}{m}} \\
					&= c,
			\end{align}
			the speed of sound. Here $g=\frac{4\pi\hbar^2a}{m}$, and $a$ the $s$-wave scattering length. The weakly interacting Bose gases can become superfluid.\\			

			Liquid helium below the $\lambda$-point has a similar energy dispersion relation (see Figure \ref{fig:dispersion-relation}) hence reinforcing the notion that superfluidity and Bose--Einstein condensation are two intimately related concepts. The experimental value of the speed of sound is $\sim\!57.5\unit{m/s}$.
			
		\subsection{Rotation and vorticity in superfluids}\label{sec:rot-vort}
			\begin{figure}[t]
				\begin{center}
					\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{vortex-xy}
					\caption{Cross section of a $^4$He droplet through a symmetry plane. The droplet is made of 1000 atoms. Superimposed in cyan are the streamlines of the velocity field $\vec{v}_s$ for $s=1$. They are concentric circles, centred around the vortex core along the $z$-axis. The colour scale encodes for the density $\rho(r)$. The radius of the droplet is about 22\,\AA.}
					\label{fig:vortex-xy}
				\end{center}
			\end{figure}
		
			Starting from time-dependent Euler--Lagrange (EL) equation (Eq. \ref{eq:td-el-equation}, see Chapter \ref{sec:dft-method}) for the time-evolution of the order parameter $\Psi$ (Eq. \ref{eq:order-param-complex}, dropping the ground-state subscript and allowing $\varphi$ and $S$ to vary in time)
			\begin{align}
				i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi({\mathbf r},t) = \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\laplacian + \frac{\delta{\cal E}_{c}}{\delta\rho}\right]\Psi(\textbf{r},t)
			\end{align}
			one left-multiplies it with the complex conjugate of the order parameter $\Psi^*$ and then subtract the complex conjugate of the whole expression on both sides. After some algebra and defining $\rho(\vec{r},t)\vcentcolon=N\abs{\varphi(\vec{r},t)}^2$, one arrives at the continuity equation
			\begin{align}
				\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \div{\vec{j}}=0, \label{eq:continuity-eq}
			\end{align}
			with
			\begin{align}
				\vec{j}(\vec{r},t) \vcentcolon=& -\frac{i\hbar}{2m}\qty\big[\Psi^*(\vec{r},t)\grad{\Psi}(\vec{r},t) - \Psi(\vec{r},t)\grad{\Psi^*}(\vec{r},t)] \\
					=&\,\rho(\vec{r},t)\frac{\hbar}{m}\grad{S(\vec{r},t)}
			\end{align}
			From Eq. (\ref{eq:continuity-eq}) it follows that the atomic number density is a conserved quantity.\\
			
			We can identify the collective velocity $\vec{v}_s$ of the superfluid through the relation
			\begin{align}
				\vec{v}_s(\vec{r},t) = \vec{j}/\rho=\frac{\hbar}{m}\grad{S(\vec{r},t)} \label{eq:velocity-field}
			\end{align}
			and we see that the rotation of the velocity field of the superfluid $\curl{\vec{v}_s}=0$, i.e. the fluid is said to be \emph{irrotational}; a typical property of superfluids. Conversely, taking the curl $\curl{\vec{j}}=\frac{\hbar}{m}\grad{\rho}\times\grad{S}$ we see that this is merely a restatement of the fact that one needs a gas or liquid with a non-uniform density and a non-zero phase for it to be able to support vortices.\\
			
			Let us consider the illustrative example of a line vortex through the origin along the $z$-axis. As will be demonstrated in Section \ref{sec:vortical-states}, this is a stationary state of the droplet Hamiltonian and therefore its time dependence is just a multiplicative factor. In cylindrical coordinates $(r,\varphi,z)$ such a vortex solution has the form
			\begin{align}
				\Psi_s(\vec{r}) = \sqrt{\rho(r)}\unit{e}^{is\varphi}, \label{eq:line-vortex}
			\end{align}
			with $s$ an integer. This is an eigenfunction of the angular momentum operator $\hat{L}_z$ with eigenvalue
			\begin{align}
				\hat{L}_z \Psi_s(\vec{r}) &= \frac{\hbar}{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial\varphi}\Psi_s(\vec{r}) = \hbar s\Psi_s(\vec{r})
			\end{align}
			and with expectation value
			\begin{align}
				\expval{\hat{L}_z} &= \expval{\hat{L}_z}{\Psi_s} \\
					&= \hbar s \braket{\sqrt{N_0}\varphi_0} \\
					&= N_0\hbar s
			\end{align}
			The angular momentum is quantised and proportional to the number of bosons in the BEC fraction/superfluid. We can calculate the velocity field
			\begin{align}
				\vec{v}_s = \frac{\hbar}{m}\grad{S} = \frac{\hbar}{m}\frac{s}{r}\,\vu*{\varphi}
			\end{align}
			The streamlines of $\vec{v}_s$ are concentric circles, centred around the z-axis, lying in the $xy$-plane (see Figure \ref{fig:vortex-xy}). Contrary to rigid rotation fields which increase proportional to the distance from the $z$-axis $r$, the superfluid rotation field decreases proportional to distance from the $z$-axis $1/r$ and is singular in the origin. Calculating the circulation of the velocity field $\vec{v}_s$ along a closed contour including the $z$-axis gives
			\begin{align}
				\oint_{\partial\Sigma}\!\vec{v}_s\cdot\unit{d}\vec{l} &=
				\int_{0}^{2\pi}\!\frac{\hbar}{m}\frac{s}{r}\,\vu*{\varphi}\cdot r\unit{d}\varphi\,\vu*{\varphi} \\
					&= 2\pi s\frac{\hbar}{m}
			\end{align}
			There are two things to note here. Firstly, the circulation around a closed loop that encompasses the $z$-axis is quantised in units of $\hbar/m$ for $s\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}$. Secondly, the value of the circulation of the velocity field does not depend on the chosen contour as long as it includes the location of the vortex. This means that all the vorticity is contained at the location where the velocity field is singular (the ``core'' of the vortex), at $r=0$ along the $z$-axis.\\
			
			Because of the pole in the velocity field, Stokes theorem will lead to the following contradiction
			\begin{align}
				2\pi s\frac{\hbar}{m}=\oint_{\partial\Sigma}\!\!\!\vec{v}_s\cdot\unit{d}\vec{l} = \iint_{\Sigma}\!\curl{\vec{v}_s}\cdot\unit{d}\vec{\Sigma} = 0
			\end{align}
			and can therefore not be applied. To emphasise that all the vorticity is concentrated around the vortex core one can write formally
			\begin{align}
				\curl{\vec{v}_s} = 2\pi s\frac{\hbar}{m}\delta^{(2)}(\vec{r}_\perp)\,\vu{z},
			\end{align}
			where $\delta^{(2)}$ is 2-dimensional Dirac-delta function and $\vec{r}_\perp$ a vector in a plane perpendicular to the vortex line.\\

	\section{Helium droplets}
		\lettrine[lines=3,findent=3pt,nindent=0pt]{U}{ntil} the 1980, most experimental and theoretical work was done on bulk systems, i.e. systems of the order of $N_A$ number of atoms. It was only in the last couple of decades that advancements in technology enabled experimentalists to create nanoscale sized superfluid helium droplets. From the early 1990's onwards, superfluid helium nano-droplets became an active field of study, both experimentally and theoretically. Surely, the finite size of these droplets would impose some interesting properties as compared to bulk liquid helium.\\
		
		The helium-helium interaction is already weak in bulk liquid helium and in finite self-bound systems such as droplets it is even weaker, e.g. the binding energy per atom is $<\!7.17\unit{K}$. Because of this, helium droplets cool down very rapidly due to evaporation, reaching their limiting temperature of about $0.38\unit{K}$ in microseconds. Pure helium droplets are neutral systems and their properties like their size, binding energy and excitation spectra, are not easy to determine experimentally and are usually obtained by indirect methods. This didn't stop the theoreticians describe doped $^4$He$_N$ droplets using a wide variety of approaches depending on the size and character of the droplets ranging from Quantum Monte Carlo, Hypernetted-Chain/Euler-Lagrange, Variational Monte Carlo and many others.\\
	
		A key property of helium droplets, in contrast to bulk helium, is their ability to pickup any kind of dopants with which they collide. Depending on the relative strength of the He-dopant interaction compared to the He-He interaction, impurities either get bound to the surface of the droplet (e.g. the alkalies) or get absorbed into their interior. They can therefore be doped with almost any kind of atomic or molecular species where they can form new complexes. This enables a broad spectrum of possible experimental study. Due to the fact that helium droplet are ultra cold superfluid liquids, and therefore provide high mobility of any picked-up dopants, one can do high resolution spectroscopy studies. Having a fine control over the number of picked-up dopants[29] one can use droplets as a matrix for creating self-organising structures of polar molecules, or very cold metal clusters and study their Coulomb explosion. From the perspective of the droplet it's possible to use the dopants as gentle probes to determine the superfluid properties of helium droplets that would be inaccessible with other methods. For two examples of this see [37-39], where a dopant is used to probe the superfluid character of small $^4$He droplets and [16,17] to see their limiting temperatures.\\

		One of the most intriguing properties of superfluid helium droplets is the fact that they can host quantised vortices. Because of their ultra low temperature they are true quantum liquids and thus their vorticity and angular momentum are quantised. The existence of quantised vortices was anticipated because they have been created and observed in Bose-Einstein condensates made of dilute gases. However, the detection of quantised vortices is still experimentally challenging. Recently, Gomez, Loginov and Vilesov performed experiments[PRL 108, 155302 (2012)] where vortices inside superfluid $^4$He droplets, produced by the expansion of liquid helium, were traced by introducing Ag atoms which clustered along the vortex lines, into the droplets. The Ag clusters were subsequently surface-deposited and imaged via electron microscopy. The prevalence of elongated track-shaped deposits (see Figure \ref{fig:vortex-array}) shows that vortices are present in droplets larger than about $300\unit{nm}$ and that their lifetime exceeds a few milliseconds. Two years later Gomez reported[Science 345, 906 (2014)] on the formation of quantum vortex lattices inside droplets. He used single-shot femtosecond x-ray coherent diffractive imaging to investigate the rotation of single, isolated superfluid helium-4 droplets containing $\sim\!10^8$ to $10^{11}$ atoms. The formation of quantum vortex lattices inside the droplets was confirmed by observing the characteristic Bragg patterns from xenon clusters trapped in the vortex cores (see Figure \ref{fig:vortex-array}).\\

		A lot of of work has been done on helium droplets the last few decades, both experimentally and theoretically. From the absorption spectra of alkali metal doped helium droplets, the study of doped mixed $^3$He--$^4$He droplets, electrons in liquid helium, to the investigation of the critical Landau velocity inside small $^4$He droplet. For a comprehensive overview of work done in the last two decades, the interested reader is referred to the review papers[JLTP.Vol142.Nos.1/2(2006), IRPC.Vol36No4.621-707(2017), IRPC.Vol33No3.301-339(2014)].

	\section{Structure of the thesis}
		\lettrine[lines=3,findent=3pt,nindent=0pt]{T}{his} thesis will consist of two parts, since the presented work focusses on two distinct areas of interest with no mutual overlap. Each part will have its own short introduction to motivate the performed research and put in a broader context. The final chapter will conclude with some work in progress, planned work that has yet to start, and some ideas on how the method might be extended to be used in future research that is either cumbersome or impossible in its current form.

		\subsection{Part I: Excited state dynamics}
			In this part of the thesis the real-time dynamics of a single electronically excited rubidium (Rb) atom, residing in the surface dimple of a helium nano-droplet will be presented. The atom will be excited from its ground state 5s$^2\Sigma_{1/2}$ to the 5p$^2\{\Sigma,\Pi\}$ and 6p$^2\{\Sigma,\Pi\}$ manifold. This will be a combined experimental and theoretical study. The results are presented in two published articles:\\
		
			\emph{Imaging Excited-State Dynamics of Doped He Nanodroplets in Real-Time} will focus on imaging and characterising the dynamics using femtosecond spectroscopy and  time-dependent density functional theory.\\
		
			\emph{Desorption dynamics of RbHe-exciplexes off He nanodroplets induced by spin relaxation} is a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the formation of free RbHe-exciplex molecules from laser-excited Rb-doped He nanodroplets through the mechanism of electronic spin relaxation. The role of relaxation of internal degrees of freedom of the RbHe exciplex in the desorption process has not been explicitly addressed.

		\subsection{Part II: Collisions and capture by quantised vortices}
			The second part investigates the real-time capture process of single xenon and argon atoms in their ground state by $^4$He$_{1000}$ droplets. Specifically it will address the interaction between a captured xenon or argon atom and a single quantised vortex line in the interior of the droplet. It will contain only theoretical investigations. The results will also be presented in two published works:\\
		
			\emph{Head-on Collisions of Xe Atoms Against Superfluid $^4\!$He Nanodroplets} studies the kinematics of head-on collisions between a xenon atom and a helium droplet. This scenario is then compared to a previous study of the same process with caesium to get a clear picture of the differences in dynamic behaviour between heliophilic and heliophobic species in said process. It also investigates different velocity regimes.\\
		
			\emph{Capture of Xe and Ar atoms by quantized vortices in $^4\!$He nanodroplets} addresses the capture of xenon and argon atoms at different velocity regimes and impact factors to determine the effective cross section for capture. This investigation then repeated with a dropet hosting one quantised line vortex. Also some preliminary results are presented for a larger droplet hosting an array of 6 line vortices, lined with argon atoms.
