Colliding protons at 14 TeV center-of-mass energy and high luminosity, it will probe the structure of matter down to an unprecedentedly fine scale, thus allowing to reproduce in the laboratory phenomena which occurred in the very early universe. On the technological side, the LHC makes use of high-field superconducting magnets for guidance and focusing of the particle beams around the 26.7 km circumference of the machine, to be installed in the existing LEP tunnel. The nominal bending field of 8.65 T is produced in some 1300 twin-aperture dipoles, wound with small-filament NbTi conductor, and operated below 1.9 K in static baths of pressurized helium II, thus taking advantage of its specific properties as cooling fluid. We present the main technical challenges of the LHC cryogenic system, and review the actions of development and the preparatory work in progress.},

We calculate the equilibrium configurations and binding energies of single alkali atoms near the liquid-vapor interface of4He and3He. A simple interface model is used to predict the surface deformation due to the presence of the atoms. A more realistic density functional model yields somewhat higher energies in the case of4He. For all alkali atoms, we find the surface binding energies to be around 10 to 20 K. A similar analysis with atom-H2 interactions finds that alkali atoms tend to submerge into liquid H2, with the exception of Li.},

  abstract = {Large helium clusters, ranging in size from a few hundred to several thousand atoms, are produced in a nozzle expansion. Combining this source with a pick-up scattering cell in which the clusters can be seeded with chromophores allows us to probe the influence of the helium environment on the atoms and molecules attached to the clusters. Using an alkali as chromophore we recorded laser induced fluorescence spectra of Na atoms and molecules attached to helium clusters. Apart from the spectrum of the Na monomer, we have found spectroscopic bands which can unambiguous be assigned to two bound Na atoms. The first of this bands is due to 11 ∑                  $\mu$                  +                (A) {\textleftarrow} 11 ∑                                      g                                    +                (X) excitations of the covalently bound singlet Na2 molecule while the second is due to 13 ∑                                      g                                    +                 {\textleftarrow} 13 ∑                                      $\mu$                                    +                 excitations for the van der Waals bound triplet Na2 dimer. Both bands have been vibrationally resolved. Furthermore we found very large fluorescence intensities in the region 605--635 nm which are likely due to the excitation of a species containing three Na atoms attached to a helium cluster.},

From the optical spectra of previous experiments the influence of the surrounding helium on the electronic configuration of the impurity atoms or ions was examined. In this experiment the light emitted from the defect atoms is observed by a camera. The pictures obtained yield information about the distribution and the motion of the defect particles in the superfluid.

Many different modes of oscillation of the drop are observable. The resonant frequencies of the drops are found to be a function of amplitude. Quantitative measurements of the damping of shape oscillations are made by using a laser beam focused through the drop. The observed damping of shape oscillations is found to be greater than the damping due to the viscosities of the liquid and the surrounding vapor. Other mechanisms possibly responsible for this damping are discussed. We also report experiments on drops with angular momentum.              },

Whenever possible, we compare results from different theoretical methods, with the aim of assessing the capabilities and limitations of the more phenomenological ones, that often constitute the only instrument to address some of the questions raised by current experiments.},

Convergence properties and accuracy of 2nd and 4th order operator-splitting methods for the ITP method are studied using numerical examples. The natural convergence of the method is further accelerated with a new dynamic time step adjustment method. The results show that the ITP method has better scaling with respect to matrix size as compared to the implicitly restarted Lanczos method. An efficient parallel implementation of the ITP method for shared memory computers is also demonstrated.},

  abstract  = {When two vortices cross, each of them breaks into two parts and exchanges part of itself for part of the other. This process, called vortex reconnection, occurs in classical and superfluids, and in magnetized plasmas and superconductors. We present the first experimental observations of reconnection between quantized vortices in superfluid helium. We do so by imaging micrometer-sized solid hydrogen particles trapped on quantized vortex cores and by inferring the occurrence of reconnection from the motions of groups of recoiling particles. We show that the distance separating particles on the just-reconnected vortex lines grows as a power law in time. The average value of the scaling exponent is approximately {\textonehalf}, consistent with the self-similar evolution of the vortices.},

abstract="We present the first sequential laser excitation of atom-doped helium nanodroplets. Rubidium atoms on thesurface of helium nanodroplets are selectively excited with a continuous wave laser to the 52P1/2state so as not to desorb from the nanodroplets. From there they are excited by a laser pulse to the 52Dstate; a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectrum is recorded by monitoring the62P                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}rightarrow{\$}                 52S1/2 emission. The LIF spectrum differs from that of the two-photon one-colordirect excitation spectrum 52D                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}leftarrow{\$}                 52S1/2, indicating that the system does relax vibrationallyduring the lifetime of the 52P1/2 state. To model the LIF spectra we use calculated energy levels of theRb atom as a function of its distance R from the center of the helium nanodroplet. The Franck-Condon factors ofthe resulting potential energy curves agree with the experimental spectra. In the future the 52P1/2 statecan be used as a springboard to reach high-lying 2S and 2D states, and possibly create an artificialsuper-atom.",

	Abstract = {The ``two-fluid model'' of superfluidity was first introduced by Laszlo Tisza in 1938. On that year, Tisza published the principles of his model as a brief note in Nature and two articles in French in the Comptes rendus de l'Acad\'{e}mie des sciences, followed in 1940 by two other articles in French in the Journal de physique et le Radium. In 1941, the two-fluid model was reformulated by Lev Landau on a more rigorous basis. Successive experiments confirmed the revolutionary idea introduced by Tisza: superfluid helium is indeed a surprising mixture of two fluids with independent velocity fields. His prediction of the existence of heat waves, a consequence of his model, was also confirmed. Then, it took several decades for the superfluidity of liquid helium to be fully understood.},

For single components, CBF results for the excitation energies agree quite well with experimental results, even for highly correlated systems like {$^4$He}, and recent systematic improvements of CBF achieve perfect agreement. We give a full derivation of multi-component CBF, and apply the method to a dipolar Bose gas cut into two-dimensional layers by a deep optical lattice, with coupling between layers due to the long-ranged dipole-dipole interaction. We consider the case of strong coupling, leading to large positive interlayer correlations. We calculate the spectrum for a system of 8 layers and show that the strong coupling can lead to a simpler spectrum than in the uncoupled case, with a single peak carrying most of the spectral weight. },
