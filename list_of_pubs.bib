	Abstract = {We study the head-on collision of a heliophilic xenon atom with a superfluid $^4$He droplet made of 1000 atoms. At variance with the findings for a heliophobic cesium atom of a similar atomic weight, it is found that the xenon atom has to hit the droplet with a large kinetic energy in order to get across it without being captured. When it is not captured, the xenon impurity does not emerge as a bare atom; instead, due to its heliophilic character it carries away some helium atoms.},

	Abstract = {We present a computational study, based on time-dependent Density Functional theory, of the real-time interaction and trapping of Ar and Xe atoms in superfluid $^4$He nanodroplets either pure or hosting quantized vortex lines. We investigate the phase-space trajectories of the impurities for different initial conditions and describe in detail the complex dynamics of the droplets during the capture of the impurities. We show that the interaction of the incoming atom with the vortex core induces large bending and twisting excitations of the vortex core lines, including the generation of helical Kelvin waves propagating along the vortex core. We have also calculated the stationary configurations of a 4He droplet hosting a 6-vortex array whose cores are filled with Ar atoms. As observed in recent experiments, we find that doping adds substantial rigidity to the system, such that the doped vortex array remains stable, even at low values of the angular velocities where the undoped vortices would otherwise be pushed towards the droplet surface and be expelled.},

abstract  ="Doped He nanodroplets are ideal model systems to study the dynamics of elementary photophysical processes in heterogeneous nanosystems. Here we present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the formation of free RbHe exciplex molecules from laser-excited Rb-doped He nanodroplets. Upon excitation of a droplet-bound Rb atom to the 5p3/22[capital Pi]3/2-state{,} a stable RbHe exciplex forms within about 20 ps. Only due to 2[capital Pi]3/2-\{,}\rightarrow\{,}2[capital Pi]1/2- spin-relaxation does the RbHe exciplex detach from the He droplet surface with a half life of about 700 ps{,} given by the spin-relaxation time and the coupling of spin and translational degrees of freedom."}
