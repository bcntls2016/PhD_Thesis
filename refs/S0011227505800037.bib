abstract = "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will be the next research instrument of high-energy physics. Colliding protons at 14 TeV center-of-mass energy and high luminosity, it will probe the structure of matter down to an unprecedentedly fine scale, thus allowing to reproduce in the laboratory phenomena which occurred in the very early universe. On the technological side, the LHC makes use of high-field superconducting magnets for guidance and focusing of the particle beams around the 26.7 km circumference of the machine, to be installed in the existing LEP tunnel. The nominal bending field of 8.65 T is produced in some 1300 twin-aperture dipoles, wound with small-filament NbTi conductor, and operated below 1.9 K in static baths of pressurized helium II, thus taking advantage of its specific properties as cooling fluid. We present the main technical challenges of the LHC cryogenic system, and review the actions of development and the preparatory work in progress."
