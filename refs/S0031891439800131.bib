abstract = "After a discussion of the experiments which have led to the idea that a film is formed on surfaces in contact with liquid helium II, further experiments on the anomalous evaporation from vessels containing liquid helium II are described. It is concluded from the experiments that liquid helium II ``creeps out'' of the containers in the form of a film and that this is responsible for the anomalous effects observed."
