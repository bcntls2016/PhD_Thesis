		\lettrine[lines=3,findent=3pt,nindent=0pt]{T}{he} following article will focus on imaging and characterising the dynamics using femtosecond spectroscopy and time-dependent density functional theory. Specifically on the idea of a fall-back time, which is defined as the time delay $\tau\vcentcolon=t_{ion}-t_{exc}$ between the time instance of the photo-excitation of Rb to the 5p and 6p states, and the time instance of its photo-ionisation, such that the Rb cation is still solvated by the helium droplet.\\

	\section{Desorption dynamics of RbHe exciplexes}
		\lettrine[lines=3,findent=3pt,nindent=0pt]{H}{ow} does a Rb atom, excited to the 5p$\,^2\Pi_{3/2}$ state, detached from a droplets surface---as the experiments show---even tough this is not predicted by TD-DFT calculations? That is the main question that led to this work. Upon photo-excitation of Rb to the 5p$\,^2\Pi_{3/2}$ state, a He atom may be attached to it forming a HeRb exciplex; this cannot happen if Rb is excited to the 5p$\,^2\Pi_{1/2}$ state because it finds a barrier preventing exciplex formation.\\
		
		In the gas phase, a HeRb 5p$\,^2\Pi_{1/2}$ exciplex can be formed if there is enough kinetic energy for Rb* to overcome the potential barrier; alternatively, the collision of the HeRb 5p$\,^2\Pi_{3/2}$ exciplex with another atom or complex might relax the Rb* atom from the 5p$\,^2\Pi_{3/2}$ to the 5p$\,^2\Pi_{1/2}$ state, overcoming the barrier as the potential wells for both states are at similar Rb-He distances. In the condensed (droplet) phase at 0.4 K temperature, none of these mechanisms are active to explain the formation of HeRb 5p$\,^2\Pi_{1/2}$ exciplexes and their potential ejection.\\

		However, a possible mechanism for this is non-radiative de-excitation from the 5p$\,^2\Pi_{3/2}$ to the 5p$\,^2\Pi_{1/2}$ that populates the later state and leaves the Rb* atom with enough kinetic energy so as to be ejected. Notice from the figure that the minimum of the 5p$\,^2\Pi_{3/2}$ potential is 12683 cm1, and that of the 5p$\,^2\Pi_{1/2}$ potential is at 12518 cm1; the value of this potential at the barrier is 12611 cm1. Thus, non-radiative de- excitation of the Rb* atom may add to its original kinetic energy of up to 165 cm1. It is worth noting that it will be ejected in the 5p$\,^2\Pi_{1/2}$ state, and not in the 5p$\,^2\Pi_{3/2}$ it was previously photo-excited.\\
		
		This publication contains a extension of our combined experimental and theoretical investigation presented in the previous section. Here we focus on the formation of free RbHe-exciplex molecules from laser-excited Rb-doped He nanodroplets through the mechanism of electronic spin relaxation. The role of relaxation of internal degrees of freedom of the RbHe exciplex in the desorption process has not been explicitly addressed.

	\section{Supervised work: potassium-doped\\nanodroplets}
		\lettrine[lines=3,findent=3pt,nindent=0pt]{U}{nder} the supervision of Nadine Halberstadt and me, a master stage -- \emph{M2 Physique Fondamentale} -- titled ``\emph{\textbf{Dynamics of a superfluid helium nanodroplet doped with a single potassium atom}}'' has been performed by Maxime Martinez.\\
	
		The project investigates the static and dynamic behaviour of a single potassium atom excited from the K-$^4$He$_{1000}$ equilibrium configuration to the K*(4p)-$^4$He$_{1000}$ and K*(5s)-$^4$He$_{1000}$ states. The choice of potassium was motivated by a discrepancy in the time-resolved experimental studies\citep{Schulz2001,Reho2000-1,Reho2000-2}. Moreover, the mass of potassium sits between those of the heavier alkalis like rubidium and cesium, and the lighter ones, like lithium and sodium. Therefore, potassium presents an interesting case, being on the borderline between the classical regime for heavy alkalies and a quantum--mechanical regime for the lighter ones. Both treatments of the equilibrium properties and the 5s$\leftarrow$4s excitation are studied. This work is not included in the thesis but can be found in this reference \citep{Martinez2017}.
